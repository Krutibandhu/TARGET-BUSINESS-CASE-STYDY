## ✅ What does 'good' look like?

### 1. Import the dataset and do usual exploratory analysis steps like checking the structure & characteristics of the dataset:

* Data type of all columns in the `customers` table.
* Get the time range between which the orders were placed.
* Count the Cities & States of customers who ordered during the given period.

---

### 2. In-depth Exploration:

* Is there a growing trend in the no. of orders placed over the past years?
* Can we see some kind of monthly seasonality in terms of the no. of orders being placed?
* During what time of the day, do the Brazilian customers mostly place their orders?

  ▪ 0-6 hrs : Dawn
  ▪ 7-12 hrs : Mornings
  ▪ 13-18 hrs : Afternoon
  ▪ 19-23 hrs : Night

---

### 3. Evolution of E-commerce orders in the Brazil region:

* Get the month on month no. of orders placed in each state.
* How are the customers distributed across all the states?

---

### 4. Impact on Economy:

Analyze the money movement by e-commerce by looking at order prices, freight and others.

* Get the % increase in the cost of orders from year 2017 to 2018 (include months between Jan to Aug only).
  You can use the `payment_value` column in the payments table to get the cost of orders.

* Calculate the Total & Average value of order price for each state.

* Calculate the Total & Average value of order freight for each state.

---

### 5. Analysis based on sales, freight and delivery time:

* Find the no. of days taken to deliver each order from the order’s purchase date as delivery time.
  Also, calculate the difference (in days) between the estimated & actual delivery date of an order.
  Do this in a single query.

  You can calculate the delivery time and the difference between the estimated & actual delivery date using the given formula:
  ▪ `time_to_deliver = order_delivered_customer_date - order_purchase_timestamp`
  ▪ `diff_estimated_delivery = order_delivered_customer_date - order_estimated_delivery_date`

* Find out the top 5 states with the highest & lowest average freight value.

* Find out the top 5 states with the highest & lowest average delivery time.

* Find out the top 5 states where the order delivery is really fast as compared to the estimated date of delivery.
  You can use the difference between the averages of actual & estimated delivery date to figure out how fast the delivery was for each state.

---

### 6. Analysis based on the payments:

* Find the month on month no. of orders placed using different payment types.
* Find the no. of orders placed on the basis of the payment installments that have been paid.
